# Sprint: Pre-Data Improvements
**Branch:** `claude/explore-plan-next-steps-3jlhmh`  
**Goal:** Build robustness, tests, and dashboard features while waiting for data to accumulate (7d deltas arrive ~2026-06-16; full 30d picture ~2026-07-09)

## Board

### 🔴 Backlog

| # | Task | File(s) | Effort |
|---|------|---------|--------|
| 6b | Sector → Industry drill-down | `dashboard/app.py` | L |

> Hardcode `SECTOR_INDUSTRY_MAP` (11 sectors → 144 industries) in `app.py`. Sidebar selectbox filters all tabs. Effort is mostly cataloguing the mapping, not code.

## Known Issue: GitHub Actions Runners

Every workflow run in this repo fails instantly (`runner_id: 0`, completes in ~4s, logs 404). This affects **all** trigger types: `push`, `pull_request`, and `workflow_dispatch`. Zero `collect.yml` runs exist in the Actions history either — confirming the data CSVs were all populated locally, not via CI.

**Root cause:** GitHub Actions runners are not being allocated for this account/repo. This is likely a billing or account-level restriction, not a YAML issue. The `tests.yml` and `collect.yml` YAML files are structurally correct and will work on any standard GitHub account with Actions enabled.

**To fix:** Check GitHub account → Settings → Billing → Actions usage, or enable Actions under repo Settings → Actions → General.

## Next Milestones

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| ~2026-06-16 | 7d deltas available — Heatmap + Top Movers light up |
| ~2026-06-23 | 14d deltas available |
| ~2026-07-09 | 30d deltas available — full picture |

After 7d data arrives: consider adding `rank_day_delta_7d` to the delta schema (same pattern as `rank_week_delta_7d`).

## Verification Checklist

- [x] `pytest tests/ -v` — 56 tests pass
- [x] `python scripts/compute_deltas.py` — migrates existing CSVs, `rank_day` in output
- [x] Dashboard: rank cols in Snapshot, download buttons, Time Series multiselect, Heatmap "need 7 days" message
- [x] GH Actions `collect.yml` — timeout + row-count step present
- [x] Push branch; draft PR #3 created
- [x] T7: `collect()` guard tests added (TestCollectRowCountGuard)
- [x] T8: `tests.yml` CI workflow YAML added and correct (runner allocation issue is account-level)
- [x] T9: `ensure_deltas_csv` path tests added (TestEnsureDeltasCsv)
