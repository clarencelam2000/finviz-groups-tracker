# Sprint: Pre-Data Improvements
**Branch:** `claude/explore-plan-next-steps-3jlhmh`  
**Goal:** Build robustness, tests, and dashboard features while waiting for data to accumulate (7d deltas arrive ~2026-06-16; full 30d picture ~2026-07-09)

## Board

### 🔴 Backlog

| # | Task | File(s) | Effort | Notes |
|---|------|---------|--------|-------|
| D1 | **[USER ACTION] Create `main` branch, set as default** | GitHub UI | S | Blocks cron and PWA-1. Merge `claude/elegant-babbage-hlxnfy` → new `main`, then Settings → Branches → change default. |
| PWA-1 | Fix hardcoded `BRANCH` constant in PWA | `docs/index.html` line ~117 | S | Change `'claude/elegant-babbage-hlxnfy'` to `'main'` (or whichever branch receives daily cron data). Depends on D1. |
| INS-4 | **Momentum Velocity (`momentum_score_delta_7d/14d`)** | `scripts/compute_deltas.py` | M | Track momentum_score change over time. "Rising Stars" = positive velocity + currently top-half. Needs 7+ days of data. |
| INS-5 | **Daily Brief card (PWA top-of-screen)** | `docs/index.html` | M | Single card: today's breakout, sustained leaders, what's rolling over. Eliminates tab-hopping on mobile. Needs 7+ days for interesting content. |
| INS-6 | **Momentum Score Heatmap (time × industry)** | `dashboard/app.py` | S | Companion to existing rank-delta heatmap — cells = `momentum_score` over time. Absolute picture of sustained leaders. Needs 7+ days. |
| INS-7 | **Sector Breadth** | `dashboard/app.py` | L | % of industries in a sector that are top-half of full universe. Needs static sector→industry mapping (11 sectors × 144 industries). Hardest feature. |
| DEBT-1 | `evict_today_rows` concurrency race | `scripts/collect.py` | S | Two simultaneous `collect.py` processes could race on read-modify-write. Non-issue given single scheduled Action + ad-hoc manual runs. Fix would be a file lock (e.g. `fcntl.flock`). Table until concurrency is actually needed. |
| DEBT-2 | `evict_today_rows` I/O errors not caught | `scripts/collect.py` | S | Disk-full / permission errors bubble up as exceptions. Intentional — matches rest of codebase. Could add explicit error message if this causes confusion in prod logs. |
| 6b | Sector → Industry drill-down | `dashboard/app.py` | L | Hardcode `SECTOR_INDUSTRY_MAP` (11 sectors → 144 industries) in `app.py`. Sidebar selectbox filters all tabs. Effort is mostly cataloguing the mapping, not code. |

> **D1 note — the elegant-babbage debt**: `claude/elegant-babbage-hlxnfy` is currently the default branch (no `main` exists). GitHub Actions cron only fires on the default branch, and the PWA hardcodes this branch name. D1 is the root fix; PWA-1 is the code follow-up. Until D1 is done, the cron data will keep landing on `elegant-babbage` — so don't change the `BRANCH` constant before D1 is complete.

## Next Milestones

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| ~2026-06-16 | 7d deltas available — Heatmap + Top Movers light up |
| ~2026-06-23 | 14d deltas available |
| ~2026-07-09 | 30d deltas available — full picture |

After 7d data arrives: consider adding `rank_day_delta_7d` to the delta schema (same pattern as `rank_week_delta_7d`).

## Verification Checklist

- [x] `pytest tests/ -v` — 56 tests pass
- [x] `python scripts/compute_deltas.py` — migrates existing CSVs, `rank_day` in output
- [x] Dashboard: rank cols in Snapshot, download buttons, Time Series multiselect, Heatmap "need 7 days" message
- [x] GH Actions `collect.yml` — timeout + row-count step present
- [x] Push branch; draft PR #3 created
- [x] T7: `collect()` guard tests added (TestCollectRowCountGuard)
- [x] T8: `tests.yml` CI workflow YAML added and correct (runner allocation issue is account-level)
- [x] T9: `ensure_deltas_csv` path tests added (TestEnsureDeltasCsv)
