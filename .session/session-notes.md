# Session Notes

> **Future Claude:** read this immediately at session start. Summarize the current state for the user before doing anything else.
>
> **Format:** Append a new `---` delimited block per session. Header = date + workstream description. Keep the last 4 sessions here; a human will periodically move older entries to `.session/archive/session-notes-archive.md`. Do NOT replace existing entries — append only.

- `docs/releases.json` — v2026.06.28 entry, tag "feature", tab "lookup"
- `docs/sw.js` — CACHE bumped to finviz-v33
- `tests/test_picks_button_config.py` — NEW: 9 tests (4 BUTTON_* anti-drift + 5 sector-slug tests)
- `CLAUDE.md` / `README.md` — 4 BUTTON_* constants triple-documented
- `planning/stock-picks-from-leading-groups.md` — Phase 3c marked COMPLETE
- `.session/SPRINT.md` — PICKS-3C marked Done

478 tests pass (9 new for Phase 3c).

**Phase 3d next:** inside-day polish, fundamental floor, Focus stacked-stop bonus, staleness banner.

## 2026-06-26 — Phase 3a: Picks tab MVP + backend derived metrics

## 2026-06-25 — Picks cron dispatcher plan (PICKS-2-CRON)

**Status: PLAN COMPLETE. IMPLEMENTATION READY FOR NEXT SESSION.**

Plan written and docs committed to `claude/picks-cloudflare-cron-f0t7fz`. Extend `finviz-cron-dispatcher` with a 4th cron `31 22 * * 1-5` (22:31 UTC = 6:31 PM EDT). Routes by `event.cron` — picks cron dispatches `collect_picks.yml`. GitHub cron retired from `collect_picks.yml` (50-page scrape too expensive to misfire). Healthchecks.io dead-man's-switch planned.

**VP action item:** create healthchecks.io monitor (period=24h, grace=2h) and add `PICKS_HEALTHCHECK_URL` as repo secret before implementation merges.

**Safe to close.** Next session: implementation (worker-cron/ + collect_picks.yml).
